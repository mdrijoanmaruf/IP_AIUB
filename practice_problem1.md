    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
        sum = sum + i;
    }
    cout << "Sum is : " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another.

    int number2;

    cout << "Enter the number1 number: ";
    cin >> number1;

    cout << "Enter the number2: ";
    cin >> number2;

        for (int i = 1; i <= number2; i++) {
            result *= number1;
        }
    } 
    else {
